# Conv-LSTM
based on this paper: [Convolutional LSTM Network: A Machine Learning Approach for Precipitation Nowcasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04214)

read_radar: read radar data and save it to numpy format.

radar_forecast build the ConvLSTM network and train.

predict_and_draw draw the nowcasting results.
